Once upon a time there was a programmer. But he didn't ever use git! After all,
he was a good programmer and didn't need to. 

But one day, he made a mistake and wrote buggy code. He searched for hours for
his bug, but couldn't figure it out.

Write an ending to the story!
Unfortunately, he couldn't figure it out by the due date. Not sucumbing to his urges, the programmer decided not to cheat and took the zero like a man. The end.
